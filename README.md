[digitalflower.tech ](https://digitalflower.tech/) <---- LINK TO MY SITE

A digital bloom that truly reflects me, my work, my journey, and the things I'm passionate about. This site is my online home where I showcase my skills, projects, and everything in between.



How It's Made:

Tech Used:

HTML

CSS 

JavaScript

I built this website using a template as a foundation but heavily modified it to fit my style and needs. I focused on creating a seamless user experience with smooth transitions, interactive elements, and an aesthetic design. I also integrated custom components and tweaked the layout to make it unique and personalized.

Lessons Learned:

Building my site on a template has been a frustrating, yet rewarding experience. This site reinforced a lot of what I’ve learned about Html, CSS and Javascript. One of the biggest takeaways was fine-tuning animations without affecting performance, small CSS tweaks can make such a big difference! I also learned more about deploying and managing a live site, which was an exciting step forward in my journey as a developer. Customizing a pre-existing template taught me how to work within constraints while still making something feel completely my own.

This project is a reflection of my growth, and I’m excited to keep improving it as I learn more. Check it out and let me know what you think!
